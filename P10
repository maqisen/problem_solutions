1. Precondition left rotation: right is not null
                right rotation: left is not null
2. The object types in the tree must be comparable in order to be ranked in some sort of fashion 
3. right(15)
   left(10)
4. Left rotation 
   pre-rotation:
   x < y
   α < x
   β < y
   γ > y
   
   post-rotation: 
   x is left of y
   α is left of x
   β < y > x ; β is right of x, in order of β to originally be a child of y, it must have first been larger than x
   γ is right of y
   
   Right rotation:
   pre-rotation:
   x < y
   α < x
   β > x
   γ > y
   
   post-rotation: 
   x is left of y
   α is left of x
   β < y > x ; β is left of y, in order of β to originally be a child of x, it must have first been smaller than y
   γ is right of y
